# User Car Price Prediction

## Project Description

User Car Price Prediction is a Python project that predicts the price of a used car based on features such as model year, mileage, brand, reported accidents, transmission type, exterior color, and fuel type using neural network models.

## Data 

The link for the dataset we used in this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/used-car-price-prediction-dataset 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository from this link: https://github.com/jiwenofu/Neural-Network-Project.git

2. Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
* os
* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Usage

Run all the cells in the Jupyter notebook named ANN_Project.ipynb, which is located in the repository.

## Blog Post

The blog post for this project is available in the PDF file included in this repository.

## Explanation of the Figures Used in the Blog Post:

Figure 1: Mileage Distribution — The boxplot showing the distribution of the mileage column in the used car dataset was generated to visualize the spread of mileage values. It highlights key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and any potential outliers in the mileage data. (See the code block for creating the figure in cell 38.)

Figure 2: Mileage Distribution by Range with Mean and Median - The histogram showing the distribution of mileage in the used car dataset was generated by dividing the milage column into three ranges: low (<50k), medium (50k–100k), and high (>100k) mileage. The plot also includes vertical lines indicating the mean and median mileage values. (See the code block for creating the figure in cell 39).

Figure 3: Neural network code for the first trial, which includes three layers and ReLU activation. (See the code block at the top of cell 19).

Figure 4: Second trial neural network code, training it with five layers. (See the code block at the top of cell 21).

Figure 5: Neural network code for the third trial. (See the code block at the top of cell 23).

Figure 6: Comparison of the three trials, showing Trial 2 performing better overall. (See the output of the code block of cell 41).

Figure 7. Poisson Regression baseline model setup code. (See the code block in cell 18).

Figure 8. Comparison between the baseline model and the Trial 2 model. (See the output of the code block of cell 42).
